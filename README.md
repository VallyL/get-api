# Dynamic Post Viewer with Caching

# Description:
   This project demonstrates a simple web application that allows users to browse through posts from the JSONPlaceholder API using "left" and "right" 
   buttons for navigation.

# Key Features:
  - Asynchronous Data Fetching: Uses fetch and async/await to retrieve posts from the API asynchronously.
  - Post Caching: Implements a caching mechanism to store fetched posts, reducing redundant API requests and improving performance.
  - Error Handling: Includes try...catch blocks to handle potential errors during API calls and display appropriate feedback.
  - Dynamic Content Updates: The displayed post content dynamically updates as the user navigates through the posts using the buttons.

# Future Enhancements:
  - User Interface: Improve the user interface with more visual elements and better styling.
  - Pagination: Implement pagination for larger datasets to avoid fetching too many posts at once.

# Technologies:
  - HTML
  - Scss
  - JavaScript

# This is a basic example showcasing asynchronous data retrieval, caching, and dynamic content updates in a web application. Feel free to explore and enhance it further!
